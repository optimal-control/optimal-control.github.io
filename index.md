## Optimal control software 

If you would like to add your software or project to one of the lists please contact us at info [at] optimal-control.org.

### Trajectory optimization

[Open optimal control library](https://openocl.org) (Matlab/Octave)
: The Open Optimal Control Library is a toolbox for Matlab/Octave that facilitates modelling and formulation of (parametric) optimal control problems. It interfaces Ipopt [1] to numerically solve the optimal control problems and CasADi [2] to automatically calcuate the necessary derivatives by algorithmic differentiation.
