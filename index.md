## Optimal control software 

If you would like to add your software or project to one of the lists please contact us at info [at] optimal-control.org.

### Trajectory optimization

[Open Optimal Control Library](https://openocl.org) (Matlab/Octave)
: The Open Optimal Control Library is a toolbox for Matlab/Octave that facilitates modelling and formulation of (parametric) optimal control problems. It interfaces Ipopt [1] to numerically solve the optimal control problems and CasADi [2] to automatically calcuate the necessary derivatives by algorithmic differentiation.

### Model predictive control

[ACADO Toolkit](http://acado.github.io/) (C++, Matlab)
: ACADO Toolkit is a software environment and algorithm collection for automatic control and dynamic optimization. It provides a general framework for using a great variety of algorithms for direct optimal control, including model predictive control, state and parameter estimation and robust optimization. ACADO Toolkit is implemented as self-contained C++ code and comes along with user-friendly MATLAB interface. The object-oriented design allows for convenient coupling of existing optimization packages and for extending it with user-written optimization routines.

### Automatic differentiation

[CasADi](http://casadi.org/) (C++, Python, Matlab/Octave)
: CasADi is an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation. It facilitates rapid — yet efficient — implementation of different methods for numerical optimal control, both in an offline context and for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).
